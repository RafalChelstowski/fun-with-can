## About

Main goal of the project was to strenghten my skills with react, three.js, react-three-fiber ecosystem and blender.

## Goals

- player is able to move and interact with the enviroment;
- there are hidden tasks - "achievements", that are unlocked through some interactions;
- some interactions unlock other interactions;
- I did not want to make interaction obvious - no "witcher senses", it is moderately difficult to find all achievements;
- player is able to create an account and save the progress (google firebase auth). It is also possible to see how many achievements other players got;

## Model

Source room is a kitchen/cafeteria located in [TouK](https://touk.pl) offices in Warsaw.

I took the 3D scan of the room and surroundings using [3D Scanner](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/3d-scanner-app/id1419913995) app (it uses iPhone camera and lidar scanner, so the dimensions are close to the real life)

Then I basically recreated everything in Blender and textured in Substance Designer. 
From Blender I've exported 4k baked textures with lights/shadows + normals/metallic/roughness. Then it was really easy to create scene with gltfjsx, moving interactive parts to separate components.
